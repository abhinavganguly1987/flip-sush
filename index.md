Sush basically does one thing:
When you **switch it on**, it senses for an incoming call, if your phone is in ringing mode, and you want to put it on vibrate........
just flip it (face-down) and it'll go sush (vibrate).
And flip it back (face-back) it'll again come back into ringing.

The essence is to allow user to put phone into silent during critical situations like meetings, prayer etc, without any physical event.

And now with Version 2.0 of Sush, you can even set a _**'Quick response SMS'**_, which will be sent to the caller upon sushing her/his call!

### Permissions used by Sush
Of course, to do its intended work, Sush seeks certain permissions before you use it, the most important ones are :
- **Read phone state** This is to sense if phone is ringing, which essentially helps the app to change to and fro vibrate upon a flip
- **Access Call nogs** This is needed to support latest feature of _**'Quick response SMS'**_ to know the phone number of incoming call
- **Send SMS** This is to support the latest feature of _**'Quick response SMS'**_ to respond with configure SMS message

**Whats New with Version 2.0 of Sush** 
- Upgrade to Android target SDK version 28, with minimum SDK version 21
- New feature of 'Quick response SMS' added
- 'Share this app' and 'rate this app' feature added
- Updated UX, look and feel
