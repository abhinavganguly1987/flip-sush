# flip-sush
Repository of my debut, tiny, cute android app (:

This App is a Native Android App developed in Android Studio.
It basically does one thing:
----When you switch it on, it senses for an incoming call,
    if your phone is in ringing mode, and you want to put it on silent........
    just flip it (face-down) and it'll go sush (silent). 
    And flip it back (face-back) it'll again come back into ringing.
    
The essence is to allow user to put phone into silent during critical situations like meetings, prayer etc, 
without  any phisical event.


How to build, debug this app:

I've used Android Studio to develop this app. So it is pretty much simple.
Import the project in Android Studio, clean build it and run it on Emulator or any connected Android device

How to use this app:

1. App has one toggle switch, just turn it on ... and there you go.
2. You'll have a notification icon on notification bar, showing Sush is running.
3. Now app will sense any incoming calls and your phone state, if your current phone state is in Ringer mode, and you wish to simply put your phone to vibration, just  keep it face down...... no Hard press of any buttons, and your phone will be ... Sush.
