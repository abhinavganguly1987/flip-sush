# flip-sush
Repository of my debut, tiny, cute android app (:

This App is a Native Android App developed in Android Studio.
It basically does one thing:
----When you switch it on, it senses for an incoming call,
    if your phone is in ringing mode, and you want to put it on silent........
    just flip it (face-down) and it'll go sush (silent). 
    And flip it back (face-back) it'll again come back into ringing.
    
The essence is to allow user to put phone into silent during critical situations like meetings, prayer etc, 
without  any phisical event.
